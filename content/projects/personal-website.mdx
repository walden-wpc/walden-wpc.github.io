This project is my digital garden, a place to showcase my work and share my thoughts. I designed and built it from scratch, focusing on a clean, modern aesthetic inspired by the HMD global website.

## Core Technologies

The entire website is built upon a modern tech stack, designed for performance, scalability, and an excellent developer experience. The core technologies include Next.js for the frontend framework, Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, and MDX for content management.

This combination allows for a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-maintain website where content and presentation are cleanly separated.
